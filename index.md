## Welcome to Presento
Our project aims at building an APP that provides customized guidance to improve the users' communication and presentation skills.  The main technology involves “audio + video” analysis including deep learning, emotional detection, computational paralinguistics, gesture detection and NLP(Natural Language Processing). Customers can simply upload a short presentation video and receive instant feedback on filler words, pacing, conscienceless, facial expression, body language, and more! Our product supports various presentation styles, customized coaching, progress tracking and interactive community.
